# Steps for make MySQL work with Django

1. Install MySQL version 5.7
2. You might need to add the location of the mysql.exe to the Path variable. It will be something like C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin.
3. Open a MySQL session (run mysql -u <user> -p at the cmd prompt)
4. Open a connection to the database and create a database named mytunesdb. This is the name of the database in the settings.py file
5. Get the right *.whl from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#mysqlclient
6. Assuming pip is installed run (you can do this using windows powershell): pip install <name of the *.whl from step2> 
7. Install mysqlclient: pip install mysqlclient
8. Got to the myTunes directory with the manage.py file and run the command: python manage.py dbshell
	
If you get to the mysql prompt you are set.
